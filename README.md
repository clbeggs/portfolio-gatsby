  My Personal Portfolio created with Gatsby's default starter
</h1>

Starting with a boilerplate provided by Gatsby.js, I built a portfolio!

Note: There are differences with the development and production build, so after ~900px width the formatting starts to get messed up. For the best experience, view the website on a laptop or desktop! 
I'm in the proccess of tracking down the bug and squashing it.
