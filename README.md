  My Personal Portfolio created with Gatsby's default starter

Starting with a boilerplate provided by Gatsby.js, I built a portfolio!

Note: There are differences with the development and production build, so after ~900px width the formatting starts to get messed up. For the best experience, view the website on a laptop or desktop! 
I'm in the proccess of tracking down the bug and squashing it. 



There are issues with hydration in Gatsby.js, which makes the formatting of the website grenade. This is addressed at the following link:
